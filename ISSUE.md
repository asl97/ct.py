i am tired of the low quality of issue report so i am going to enforce strict issue report format

1. all issue must be reproducible
2. issue report must be in the format stated below
3. failure to comply with the above condition MIGHT result in issue getting mark as invalid


problem description

---
```
the FULL error traceback, not the one line error you get using try and except
```

---
```
code or info to reproduce the error

if this part is excluded and i ain't able to reproduce the error, the issue WILL be mark as invalid
```

---
additional info
